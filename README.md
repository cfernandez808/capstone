# capstone (CoPass)
Our mobile application has Businesses and Customers as users. Those who are registered as Businesses are able to leverage AWS's deep learning power to recognize if a customer has been to another business on the ecosystem recently, and if that customer has measured a "high" temperature at a previous business. If so, the customer shouldn't be allowed admittance to the business, in light of COVID-19.

As a customer, you should have a heat map of businesses on the ecosystem and the customer's reported "high temperature cases" (simulated until adaptation/deployment).

Our application seeks to serve the environment change that the national pandemic has caused by using AWS Services (Cognito, Lambda, S3, Dynamo, Rekognition, & Amplify), along side with React Native, and ViroReact for Augmented Reality rendering.
